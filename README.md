# movies-by-state
Exploratory analysis of various movies based on the US state they are set in.

See my blog post for details on how this was done and screenshot results:

Notes:
- Uses Requests, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium libraries
- Wikipedia scraping will take over 2 hours to run
- IMDB datasets are too large to upload to github easily, so you'll have to download them yourself and put them in the Data folder: https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/
- Will need a chrome driver for whatever version of Chrome you have installed, just add to root directory: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
